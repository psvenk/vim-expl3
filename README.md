# vim-expl3

## Archived

This repository is now archived because VimTeX [now ships with expl3 support by
default](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1798), so this plugin is no
longer of use to me. VimTeX's expl3 support is much better than what I cobbled
together here, so I would highly recommend using VimTeX or at least its syntax
files.

Original readme:

-----

Syntax highlighting and filetype detection for [LaTeX3 (expl3)][expl3], building
on `syntax/tex.vim` shipped with Vim.
